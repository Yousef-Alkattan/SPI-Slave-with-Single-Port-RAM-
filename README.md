# SPI Slave with Single Port RAM

This repository contains the RTL design, simulation, and implementation files for a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) communication system, including both master and slave modules.

---

## Introduction

This module implements a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) slave system with integrated RAM storage. The SPI slave receives data from an SPI master over the `MOSI` line and transmits data back over the `MISO` line. Received data is stored in a parameterized single-port RAM (`sp_RAM`) for later retrieval. The design is modular, separating the SPI protocol handling (`SPI_slave`) and memory storage (`sp_RAM`).

## Conclusion

This project implements and verifies a complete SPI communication system using Verilog and FPGA design flow. The modular approach facilitates clear separation between master, slave, and memory components. Functional simulation in QuestaSim validates correct protocol timing and data exchange, while synthesis and bitstream generation confirm the designâ€™s readiness for deployment on hardware. This environment provides a reliable reference for SPI-based communication and can be extended for higher data widths or multiple slave configurations.
